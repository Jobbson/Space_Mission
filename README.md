#  Space Missions Analysis 📊💼




 The project is based on all space missions from 1957 to August 2022, including details on the location, date, and result of the launch, the company responsible, and the name, price, and status of the rocket used for the mission.

## Recommended Analysis
- How have rocket launches trended across time? Has mission success rate increased?

- Which countries have had the most successful space missions? Has it always been that way?

- Which rocket has been used for the most space missions? Is it still active?

- Are there any patterns you can notice with the launch locations?



## Key Achievements:

### 🔍Trending Rocket Launches and Mission Success Rate over Time:

- Created a time series visualization showing the number of rocket launches per year.
- Calculated the mission success rate by dividing successful launches by total launches each year and visualize it over time to determine if there's an increasing trend.

### 🔍Countries/Company with Most Successful Space Missions:

- Created a bar chart to display the total number of successful missions by company
- Compare the top countries' success rates over time to identify any changes.

### 🔍Most Frequently Used Rocket and Its Current Status:

- Created a bar chart to show the frequency of each rocket used for space missions.
- Included information about the status (active/inactive) of each rocket.
- Analyzed if the most frequently used rocket is still active or if it has been replaced by newer models.

By conducting these analyses, i gain valuable insights into the trends and patterns of space missions over time, understand the success rates of different countries, identify the most commonly used rockets, and uncover any patterns in launch locations. These insights can inform decision-making processes and help optimize future space missions.
